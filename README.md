# CircleCI iOS Parallel Test Example 

This project is a basic iOS App with a handful of tests that can be executed. The project is intended to highlight the process of building the application once and sharing the necessary build resources in subsequent jobs that run the tests. The example shown here builds the app and then runs all of the unit tests on both iOS 11 and iOS 12 in parallel.
