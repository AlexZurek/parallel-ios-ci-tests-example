# CircleCI iOS Parallel Test Example 

This project is a basic iOS App with a handful of tests that can be executed. The project is intended to highlight the process of using CircleCI to build the application once and share the necessary build artifacts with subsequent jobs that run the tests.

The [CircleCI config](.circleci/config.yml) is where the interesting aspects of this project are located.
